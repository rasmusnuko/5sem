The test scripts assume a directory structure with a Verification
directory (this one) at the same level as the the compiler directory,
Compiler, and this test directory, Test.

In the Test directory, files with suffix .src are source files and
files with suffix .eop contain expected output of the corresponding
source files.

A good start is to be in the directory Verification and run the command

> ./runAllTests (or ./runAllTestsIV)

This will check and report on all the test files in Test. Note that
filenames prefixed with "error" are supposed to result in an error
message from the compiler or the message "INCORRECT output".

If this is not working (and probably also if it is working), it might
be good to check with the (brief) documentation for options as to how
the compiler and the generated code can be run on different platforms.
